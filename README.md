# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E-COMMERCE_DATA

As part of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze Brazilian e-commerce dataset. The dashboard tracks essential KPIs such as Total Number of Customers, Total Orders, Total Revenue, Total Profit, and Discount Impact, providing valuable insights into customer distribution, order trends, delivery time, and purchasing behavior. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, transformation, and Power BI visualization, improving my ability to analyze and interpret data effectively.
